# The Prisoner's Dilemma

An interactive web page describing some features of the Prisoner's Dilemma.

Inspired by: <br/>
* The book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Mass_(book)">Critical Mass</a> by Philip Ball<br/>
* <a href="http://timothypratley.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/you-should-be-using-figwheelreagent.html">This</a> blog post.

## Overview

Built with ClojureScript and Reagent using Leiningen, from a template generated by running:
```
lein new figwheel <name> -- --reagent
cd <name>
lein figwheel
```
and then adding code.

## Setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein do clean, cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.
